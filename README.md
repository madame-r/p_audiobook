An admin dashboard allows management of the platform content while the user can navigate through a catalog and access the audiobook player.

## Tips

If you import my sql file 'audiobook_player' located in the 00_readme folder

- You can go to yourlocalhost/login
- And use the account admin@admin.com / adminadmin
- Create audiobook informations in this order : author, genre, audiobook, chapter


Otherwise :
- Create your own account at : yourlocalhost/register
- Create audiobook informations in this order : author, genre, audiobook, chapter



If you upload your own audio files, remember to check your php.ini to change the size limit if necessary.




## Code Tricks

As a collection, chapters datas needed to be formatted on the back end side, to retrieve them on the front side  for Javascript and the audiobook player. Here is one way to do it. 


In the audiobook player controller

```php
        $chaptersData = [];
        foreach ($chapters as $chapter) {
            $chaptersData[] = [
                'id' => $chapter->getId(),
                'title' => $chapter->getTitle(),
                'audioUrl' => '/upload/chapters_audios/' . $chapter->getAudioFilename(), // Adjust based on your entity
                'duration' => $chapter->getDuration(), // Add the duration
            ];
        }



    
        return $this->render('playback/index.html.twig', [
            'audiobook' => $audiobook,
            'chapters' => $chaptersData,
            'selectedChapter' => $selectedChapter,
        ]);
```



In the audiobook player template

```html

  {% block javascripts %}

  <script id="chapters-data" type="application/json">
        {{ chapters|json_encode()|raw }}
      </script>

  {% endblock %}
```
